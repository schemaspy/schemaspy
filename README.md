This is a new code repository for SchemaSpy tool initially created and maintained [by John Currier](http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/).
I personally believe that work on SchemaSpy should be continued, and a lot of still existing issues should be resolved.
Last released version of the SchemaSpy was in 2010, and I have a plan to change this.

I would like to say thank you to John Currier for the invention of this database entity-relationship (ER) diagram generator.

My plan is to release new SchemaSpy version and concentrate on refactoring and improving it.

In new **SchemaSpy 6.0** version you will find:

1. Absolutely new amazing look and feel generated content

2. You can very easily change SchemaSpy theme because all the logic was moved outside the Java code

3. Speed of database generation improved a little

4. Generation of the html pages was changed from plain concatenated text in Java code to Moustache engine

5. In database comments you can use Markdown language what should improve user experience from reading your database documentation

6. You can also easily create in database comments links to the tables and columns

More detail will came in next days plus I have plan to start working on all not resolved issues.

## FAQ

### General

#### Schema or Catalog name can't be null
This means that Schema or Catalog information could not be extracted from connection.  
I this case you need to add options `-s [schemaName]` or `-cat [catalogName]`   
In most cases for catalog you can use `-cat %`  
In mysql you can use same as `-db`  

### OSX

#### Graphviz
There have been lots of issue with graphviz and OSX  
So install using brew `brew install graphviz --with-librsvg --with-pango`  
If you already have graphviz installed you need to uninstall and then install  
```
brew uninstall graphviz
brew install graphviz --with-pango --with-librsvg
```
Depending on OSX version  
*Older than High Sierra*, add `-renderer :quartz` to the commandline  
*High Sierra or newer*, add `-renderer :cairo` to the commandline
