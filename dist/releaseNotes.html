<h3><a href='http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net'>SchemaSpy</a> Release Notes</h3>
<ul>

<li class='release'>x.x.x - xx/xx/xxxx - Subversion revision xxx
<ul>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3429895&group_id=137197&atid=737987">
        bug 3429895</a> - java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: unable to create new native thread.<br>
        Put in a more reasonable default maximum number of database threads. 
        rev 653<br>
        Thanks to Daniel Ceregatti for reporting the issue.
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737987&aid=3428311&group_id=137197">
        bug 3428311</a> - Invalid filenames used for generated XML.<br>
        Removed @ and : delineated portions of the database name when generating the XML filenames used. 
        rev 652<br>
        Thanks to Cedric for reporting the issue.
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737987&aid=3427040&group_id=137197">
        bug 3427040</a> - SQL Server 2005 Table comments includes field comments.<br>
        rev 650<br>
        Thanks to unnamed submitter for providing the updated SQL.
    </li>
    <li>Implemented a <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/schemaspy/forums/forum/462850/topic/4613005">
        request for more compact detail pages</a>.<br>
        Detail pages will no longer show all the columns of tables within one degree of separation of the
        focal table.
        This can help reduce the complexity of those diagrams significantly while only slightly reducing
        their functionality.
        rev 648
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2965546&group_id=137197&atid=737987">
        bug 2965546</a> - Oracle DEFAULT NULL anomaly.<br>
        Changed the 'null' check to be compliant with newer versions of the JDBC drivers.
        This should reduce the possibility of false positives while giving correct
        results moving forward.
        rev 645<br>
        Thanks to Vladimir Vilinski for reporting the issue.
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=3296973&group_id=137197&atid=737987">
        bug 3296973</a> - Tables not included with -i appears in relationship tab<br>
        rev 643<br>
        Thanks to Lennart Jonsson for reporting the issue.
    </li>
    <li>Refactored to no longer require database properties and column exclusions being
        passed throughout the code.
    </li>
    <li>When dealing with multiple schemas all regular expressions are now passed 
        to child processes in the environment.  
        This is to resolve the problem where some operating system shells expanded
        the regular expressions as if they were file specifications.<br>
        rev 641
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737987&aid=3286264&group_id=137197">
        bug 3286264</a> - Incomplete cross-schema relationship details in XML<br>
        rev 637<br>
        Thanks to Damien (Damo) for identifying the deficiency and providing a fix.
    </li>
    <li>Added a Maven POM and restructured the directory layout to conform to Maven standards.</li>
    <li>Resolved a NullPointerException that occurred when evaluating cross-
        catalog tables in databases that don't report schema details.<br>
        rev 631<br>
        Thanks to Kris Zarns for identifying the issue and for providing a
        test case that easily reproduced the failure.
    </li>
    <li>Added a new <code>-columndetails</code> option that makes it possible
        to specify which details appear (and their order) on the columns tab.
        This is a list of names that can include 
        <code>id table column type size nulls auto default children parents comments</code>
        with a default list of 
        <code>id table column type size nulls auto default</code>.
        Note that <code>id</code> will only appear when run against databases
        that require column identifiers (e.g. DB2).
        <br>
        rev 631
    </li>
    <li>Can now use <code>-all</code> on databases like MySQL.  
        With MySQL you'll probably want to specify <code>-db mysql</code>
        whenever you use <code>-all</code> since a logical database is 
        required for the initial connection.<br>
        rev 630
    </li>
    <li>Links to remote tables now also have direct links to the schema too.<br>
        rev 629
    </li>
    <li>Added a summary of remote tables to the tables tab to quickly
        identify remote relationships.<br>
        rev 628
    </li>
    <li>It's now possible to supplement your real database metadata with logical
        tables and relationships.
        One possible use is with systems that store some of their data
        in non-relational data storage.
        E.g. what I did to generate <a href=http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/unifieddb/">
        an ERD for the Unified Database (UDB)</a>.
        rev 627
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3177548&group_id=137197&atid=737987">
        bug 3177548</a> - -pfp doesn't work when analyzing multiple schemas<br>
        When analyzing multiple schemas SchemaSpy now prompts for a 
        password one time.
        That password is passed to child processes through their environment
        to prevent it from being readily visible to other users on the machine.
        Note this is not a secure solution, but it's more secure than exposing 
        it on the command-line.<br>
        rev 626<br>
        Thanks to Kris Zarns for reporting the issue.
    </li>
    <li>Foundation for supporting image formats other than PNG (e.g. SVG).
        Unfortunately SVG isn't quite ready for prime time yet.<br>
        rev 625
    </li>
    <li>Added an optional <code>short_column_type</code> to 
        <code>selectColumnTypesSql</code> to simplify the generated ER diagrams.
        Otherwise they could become extremely large. 
        rev 624
    </li>
    <li>Changed default from <code>-lq</code> (low quality) to <code>-hq</code>
        (high quality) after seeing how the low quality diagrams look on 
        various systems.<br>  
        rev 623
    </li>
    <li>Implemented <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1598563&group_id=137197&atid=737990">
        feature request 1598563</a> - Show full definition for ENUM and SET types<br>
        rev 622<br>
        Thanks to Erik Meitner for the suggestion.
    </li>
    <li>Low quality rendering was always being used when multiple schemas 
        were being analyzed.  
        Now honors <code>-hq</code> or <code>-lq</code> from command-line for 
        multiples.<br>
        rev 620
    </li>
    <li>Now makes sure XML-defined FKs point to PKs.  
        If not then assumes it should have been a PK (with a warning).<br>
        rev 619
    </li>
    <li>While trying to resolve <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/schemaspy/forums/forum/462850/topic/3232728">
        a problem with MySQL's cross-schema foreign keys</a> I discovered that MySQL uses
        catalogs as a namespace mechanism from the perspective of the JDBC metadata
        services, but uses schemas to represent the same thing in INFORMATION_SCHEMA.
        Before this SchemaSpy had completely ignored catalogs, but to resolve the issue
        I had to make it fully catalog aware.
        This is a fairly significant change (and "the right thing to do") 
        that could result in other types of databases not being evaluated correctly.
        In the process I added lots of additional logging to help resolve future issues.<br>
        rev 610<br>
        Thanks to Danny Wang for identifying the issue and for providing an extremely
        concise test case.
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737990&aid=3155648&group_id=137197">
        bug 3155648</a> - Firebird requires single-threaded metadata retrieval<br>
        rev 610<br>
        Thanks to Fernando Boaglio for reporting the issue and providing a solution.
    </li>
    <li>Refactored how database drivers get resolved to make it easier for
        Maven to override.<br>
        rev 609<br>
        Thanks to James Atwill for making the suggestion.
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3148639&group_id=137197&atid=737987">
        bug 3148639</a> - FK's on views not detected<br>
        rev 608<br>
        Thanks to Michael M. for reporting the issue.
    </li>
    <li>Implemented <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737990&aid=3141248&group_id=137197">
        feature request 3141248</a> - H2 Database Support<br>
        rev 607<br>
        Thanks to Alexey Kuznetsov for providing the configuration details for this.
    </li>
    <li>Implemented <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737989&aid=3140441&group_id=137197">
        patch 3140441</a> - Table names containing #'s don't link well<br>
        The trailing portions of tables names that contained #'s were being treated 
        as anchors instead of part of the file name.
        rev 606<br>
        Thanks to Mark Berger for identifying the problem and providing the fix.
    </li>
    <li>Implemented <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737990&aid=3136739&group_id=137197">
        feature request 3136739</a> - Shared Driver Classloader<br>
        SchemaSpy now will use the default classloader if no driverPath is specified.
        This resolves issues that some people ran into when running under tools like Maven.
        rev 605<br>
        Thanks to Bruno Leonardo Gonçalves for reporting the issue and providing the fix.
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737987&aid=3101845&group_id=137197">
        bug 3101845</a> - OutOfMemoryError with back-referencing cross-schema tables.<br>
        Prevented the inadvertent recursion that was occurring. rev 602.<br>
        Thanks to Victor for reporting the issue.
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737987&aid=3096742&group_id=137197">
        bug 3096742</a> - Many pages have missing /tbody tags.<br>
        Added missing tags to generated output. rev 601.<br>
        Thanks to Jeff Greif for reporting the issue.
    </li>

        bug 3065002</a> - Doesn't show number of rows for tables that contain more than 2,147,483,647 rows.<br>
        Changed ints to longs. rev 599.<br>
        Thanks to Mark Berger for identifying the problem and providing the fix.
    </li>
    <li>Implemented <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737990&aid=3048496&group_id=137197">
        feature request 3048496</a> - Add an option to the command line parameters for MS SQL instance name<br>
        Added two new properties files (mssql-jtds-instance.properties and
        mssql05-jtds-instance.properties) for using instances with the MS SQL jTDS driver.
        These files require a -instance option to be specified on the command line, which
        is much simpler than figuring out the key=value settings that the driver requires.
        rev 598<br>
        Thanks to Tim Abell for the suggestion.
    </li>
    <li>Removed the ads from the generated pages due to generating
        close to zero revenue.  The pages should be less cluttered
        and potentially load faster.
    </li>
    <li>Added support for Teradata and SQLite databases.
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2693317&group_id=137197&atid=737989">

        Thanks to sadas for reporting the issue.
    </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class='release'>5.0.0 - 08/16/2010 - Subversion revision 591
<ul>
    <li>Added SQL to query view details for MySQL databases. 
    </li>
    <li>Implemented <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1600035&group_id=137197&atid=737990">
        feature request 1600035</a> - Exclusion regex<br>
        I don't like the inconsistency of the command line that this introduces, but
        there's a new <code>-I</code> option that takes a regular expression of tables to
        excludes from the analysis.  This is the inverse of <code>-i</code> which specifies which
        tables to include.  The two can be used together<br>
        Thanks to Erik Meitner for the suggestion.
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1537126&group_id=137197&atid=737987">
        bug 1537126</a> - XML output fails with binary columns<br>
        It took a while but I think I finally came up with a regular expression
        that'll determine if the default value is representable in XML in Unicode:<br>
        <code>^[ -\uD7FF\uE000-\uFFFD\p{L}\p{M}\p{Z}\p{S}\p{N}\p{P}]*$</code>
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2218941&group_id=137197&atid=737987">
        bug 2218941</a> - No diagrams when schema only has implied relationships<br>
        Thanks to Steven Buschman for identifying and reproducing the problem 
        and José E. Giménez for directing me to the solution.
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=2433403&group_id=137197&atid=737987">

    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/forum/message.php?msg_id=7095169">an issue</a>
        where an InvalidConfigurationException was thrown when using Sybase.
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737987&aid=2820802&group_id=137197">
        bug 2820802</a> - ConcurrentModificationException<br>
        This would sometimes occur while determining referential integrity-based
        insertion/deletion ordering with schemas that have recursive foreign
        key relationships.<br>
        Thanks to Joao Carlos Batalha for reporting the problem.
    </li>

    </li>
    <li>Implemented <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=2828474&group_id=137197&atid=737990">
        feature request 2828474</a> - Support Informix without Schemas.<br/>
        Added a new <code>-noschema</code> option for database drivers that claim that 
        they support schemas but really don't (e.g. older versions of Informix).<br>
        Thanks to Joao Batalha for reporting the problem.
    </li>
    <li>There were scenarios where SchemaSpy had difficultly resolving
        the dot executable though the PATH environment variable.
        Added a -gv option to optionally remove the dependency on having your PATH
        include Graphviz's bin directory.  
    </li>
    <li>Resolved <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737987&aid=2393049&group_id=137197">
        bug 2393049</a> - SchemaSpy fails to access metadata on z/OS-based DB2 systems<br>
        SchemaSpy now more fully supports DB2 on z/OS-based systems by specifying
        <code>-type db2zos</code>.<br>
        Thanks to Christian Riedel for providing the z/OS-specific configuration file.
    </li>

    <li>Implemented <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737990&aid=2949120&group_id=137197">
        feature request 2949120</a> - Expose object model.<br/>
        SchemaAnalyzer.analyze() now returns the gathered database metadata.
        This would typically be used with HTML-generation disabled.
        Eventually all error reporting would occur in the calling class, but
        that hasn't been implemented yet nor has the ability to generate no
        files at all.<br>
        Thanks to Dominique De Vito for the suggestion.
    </li>
    <li>Added the ability to specify the SQL used to query basic details of 
        tables and views.
        This same query can optionally return row counts or view definitions,
        possibly negating the need for additional trips to the database.<br>
        Thanks to Jason Friedman for the suggestion.
    </li>
    <li>Partially implemented <a href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737990&aid=2712121&group_id=137197">
        feature request 2712121</a> - Formatting SQL output.<br/>
        SchemaSpy still does no real formatting the View SQL, but it now
        detects that the SQL is already formatted and presents it in that form.
        I don't know if the databases typically retain this formatting
        information or not (MySQL does not).<br>
        Thanks to Reiner Kräutle for the suggestion.
    </li>
    <li>Added the ability to specify a custom SQL formatter via the -sqlFormatter
        option.  
        This formatter must implement the
        <a href='http://schemaspy.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/schemaspy/trunk/src/net/sourceforge/schemaspy/view/SqlFormatter.java?view=log'>
        SqlFormatter</a> interface and return the SQL formatted appropriately in HTML.
        Implementing a "good" formatter is basically a project in itself and beyond
        the scope of SchemaSpy, so plug in your own if desired.
        Use -dp to make the specified class visible to SchemaSpy's class loader. 
    </li>
    <li>Now treats DB2 Materialized Query Tables (MQTs) as views per
        <a href='https://sourceforge.net/projects/schemaspy/forums/forum/462849/topic/3586068'>
        Jonas Söderström's suggestion</a>.

        The new columns page has been trimmed down to help it load.
        There was also a performance issue where the visibility state of column

        Ruby on Rails databases use an "interesting" naming convention when mapping for
        tables (plural), foreign keys (singular form of referenced table name 
        suffixed by <code>_id</code>) and primary keys (always <code>id</code>).
        This release introduces the -ror (<em>R</em>uby <em>o</em>n <em>R</em>ails)

        SchemaSpy was using incorrect entity relationship diagram notations
        in the cardinality of the foreign key side of relationships.
        In many cases it showed 'one' or 'one or more' when it should have shown 'zero or more'.
        Thanks to Dan Zingaro for noticing the incorrectness and for helping
        to resolve the issue.

        There have been several requests related to this topic.<br>
        SchemaSpy now supports defining supplemental schema metadata in XML.  
        This includes defining foreign keys, remote tables, schema/table/column comments and column exclusions.

        feature request 1643953</a> - Provide way to suppress columns in images.<br>  
        This feature request resulted into a re-thinking of the compact form of the overview relationships diagram.
        The compact form now displays only primary and foreign key columns while the non-compact
        form displays all columns.  
        This is also used to indicate degrees of separation for the detailed diagrams<br>

        <a href="http://opensource.meetup.com/88/">Colorado Springs Open Source Software</a> meeting.
        One of the big advantages of jQuery is that it lets you separate behavior from
        the structure of your web pages.  There are tons of other benefits to jQuery, so
        SchemaSpy now uses it under the 
        <a href="http://jquery.com/dev/svn/trunk/jquery/MIT-LICENSE.txt">MIT license</a>.

    <li>Resolved <a
        href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=737987&aid=1481396&group_id=137197">bug
        1481396</a> - NumberFormatException in view.DotFormatter.writeHeader.  Now includes
        diagnostics to help identify Graphviz configuration issues.</li>
    <li>Cleaned-up the formatting of table details.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>2.1.2 - 02/28/2006
<ul>
<li>Now generates a relatively useful relationships page even if dot fails 
    to build the larger (and more likely to break Graphviz's dot) images.</li>
<li>Lots of minor code cleanup after cranking up Eclipse's warning levels.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>2.1.1 - 02/05/2006
<ul>
<li>Added a more descriptive error message when the correct version of 
    Graphviz dot isn't installed.</li>
<li>Some people were having problems by passing -cp to java and not to SchemaSpy.  
    The classpath-related error messages now clearly specify where -cp belongs.</li>
<li>Revamped the classpath-related error messages to include the classpath 
    entries that weren't valid.  This should make it easier to track down JDBC 
    driver issues.</li>
<li>Updated MySQL's configuration file to point to the latest JDBC drivers.  
    Also gave the URL for the Connector/J drivers.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>2.1.0 - 11/23/2005
<ul>
<li>SchemaSpy can now analyze all of the schemas of a database with one command.
    This feature should allow a DBA to do a bulk analysis, documenting every user 
    schema with one command.</li>

    - NullPointer if FK table not in analyzed schema.</li>
<li>Was missing the border along the top edge of the page.</li>
<li>Luke Hutteman found a threading issue while reviewing portions of the code.  
    Thanks Luke!</li>

    - Tab background color mis-named.</li>
<li>Resolution of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1351488&group_id=137197&atid=737987">bug 1351488</a>
    - Relationships tab displayed when no relationships exist.</li>
<li>The layout of the tab area is now significantly cleaner.</li>
<li>Added -rankdirbug option to deal with the dot bugs that invariably result from 
    using a non-standard rankdir in .dot files.  
    This option should not be used unless absolutely necessary.</li>
<li>Refactored many of the 'formatters' to become 'pages'.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>2.0.0 - 11/06/2005
<ul>
<li>SchemaSpy now uses a tabbed layout that results in a significantly cleaner page.</li>
<li>You now have the ability to explicitly exclude columns from the relationship 
    analysis using a regular expression notation.  
    This keeps those pesky tables that are related to everything from severely 
    cluttering your view of your schema.</li>
<li>Added information in the graphs about how many 'parent' and 'child' tables are 
    related to a given table.  
    This gives a visual clue that there are more tables beyond the outskirts of 
    what's currently visible.</li>
<li>SchemaSpy now supports HSQLDB thanks to bension providing a hsqldb.properties 
    configuration file.</li>
<li>Added support for DB2 UDB Type 4 driver.</li>
<li>The graphs are now clearer due to the use of a sans serif font.</li>
<li>Resolution of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1340880&group_id=137197&atid=737987">bug 1340880</a>
    - accent characters cause dot to fail.  
    SchemaSpy now generates the .dot files using the UTF-8 character set, which 
    is what the dot program expects.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>1.7.1 - 10/20/2005
<ul>
<li>Added support for DB2's Net (Type 4) driver.</li>
<li>Resolution of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1325650&group_id=137197&atid=737987">bug 1325650</a>.
    Was having more problems with extracting information on Oracle indexes.  
    Due to an Oracle driver bug (Oracle bug #2686037) I inverted how the 
    selectIndexesSql gets evaluated and significantly optimized the SQL.  
    Thanks to Andrea for helping to figure all of this out.</li>
<li>Added details of the -cp option to the diagnostic messages when unable to 
    load database drivers.</li>
<li>Fixed some minor cosmetic problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>1.7.0 - 10/11/2005
<ul>
<li>SchemaSpy now supports PostgreSQL thanks to Tomi Ollila providing a 
    pgsql.properties.</li>
<li>Added a new page that lists all of the columns (with details) in the schema.  
    The intent of this page is to make it easier to find inconsistencies in the 
    schema as well as make it easier to do things like search for all instances 
    of a certain type of column (e.g. 'timestamp').</li>
<li>Resolution of <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1283622&group_id=137197&atid=737987">bug 1283622</a>.
    A user from the Slovak Republic ran into problems where dot was unable to 
    deal with some of the characters that are in this character set.  
    Now it should handle them appropriately.</li>
<li>Refactored how the links on each page get generated.  
    It was pretty much cut and paste before.  
    Now it's consolidated in HtmlFormatter.writeTableOfContents() so it's much 
    more consistent and easier to change.</li>
<li>Implemented <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1312220&group_id=137197&atid=737990">feature request 1312220</a>:
    Modified build.xml to include an appropriate level of debug information 
    (source files and line numbers).</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>1.6.1 - 09/16/2005
<ul>
<li>Fixed Utilities page to not have the 'Generated by SchemaSpy' label on each 
    table.</li>
<li>Yan-Fa Li figured out what was causing dot problems on Unix: quotes around 
    filenames.</li>
<li>Updated the legend to somewhat match the new IE diagram representation.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>1.6.0 - 09/11/2005 
<ul>
<li>Now displays graphical relationships using Information Engineering (IE) notation.
    This should make it easier to understand the different types of relationships 
    in the schema.</li>
<li>Beefed-up the code that detects if dot is being executed correctly.
    Some users were getting output that implied that dot was working, but no images 
    were created.</li>
<li>Added version information to .dot files to help debugging.</li>
<li>Anomalies page had some anomalies.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>1.5.2 - 09/03/2005
<ul>
<li>Implemented <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1280949&group_id=137197&atid=737990">feature request 1280949</a>:
    Many of DB2's error messages don't give table, column or constraint names but 
    instead give their IDs.  
    As a developer it's a pain to have to try to translate these IDs into something useful.
    SchemaSpy previously gave these details before I converted to the JDBC metadata 
    approach, which doesn't return these IDs.  
    It now displays these IDs for database types that support it and that have the 
    appropriate SQL defined in their properties files.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li class='release'>1.5.0 - 08/30/2005
<ul>
<li>Now displays two versions of the main relationships graph: a smaller 'compact' 
    version and a large full-size version.  
    The compact version should make it easier to get a 'big picture' view of the 
    relationships.</li>
<li>Now takes advantage of the GraphVis dot 2.6 ability to point to the East/West 
    center of a node if running dot 2.6 or higher.</li>
<li>Figured out a way to have the graph point to the appropriate portion of the 
    main table in the table detail pages.</li>
<li>Introduced a new anomaly: Columns whose default value is the word 'NULL' or 'null',
    but the SQL NULL value may have been intended.</li>
<li>Realized that index sort order relates to the column, not the index.  
    Not sure what I was thinking.</li>
<li>Added some instructions on the format of connectionSpec in the .properties files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
